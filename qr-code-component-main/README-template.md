## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Recap what I've learnt so far as a beginner, HTML tag for container, and basic CSS properties such as

```css
.outer-container {
    height: 435px;
    width: 260px;
    margin: 40px auto;
    border-radius: 15px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    text-align: center;
}
```

And review how to structure html to form containers properly

### Continued development

I would use and apply more HTML tags, learn more CSS properties. Trying to make result page to be similar as design.

### Useful resources
